Pratham is in his third year of undergraduate studies in Statistics and Economics at the University of Toronto, and joins the lab thanks to a <a href='https://tcairem.utoronto.ca/news/t-cairem-announces-2024-cohort-summer-research-students'>T-Cairem award</a>. 
Pratham will work on LLM-based data extraction from <a href="https://ohcrn.ca/"> Ontario Hereditary Cancer Network</a> reports to retrieve structure data and harmonize variant information using <a href="https://www.ga4gh.org/"> Global Alliance for Genomics and Health</a> standards.
