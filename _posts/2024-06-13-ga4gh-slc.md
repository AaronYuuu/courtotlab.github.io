Dr Heidi Rehm, Global alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) chair, announced the [formation of the GA4GH Strategic Leadership Committee](https://www.ga4gh.org/news_item/a-letter-from-the-chair-introducing-the-members-of-the-inaugural-ga4gh-strategic-leadership-committee/) and the appointment of its inaugural cohort of leaders. Following an open nomination process, ten individuals were selected to join the Strategic Leadership Committee. SLC members have substantial experience working both within GA4GH and in related fields, and will contribute a wide breadth of expertise and a diversity of perspectives to the GA4GH leadership team. 

I am very pleased to be part of such an amazing group of long-time colleagues and can't wait to contribute to GA4GH further - if there is anything that you would like GA4GH to consider, or if you're interested in being involved, please [let me know](contact)!
